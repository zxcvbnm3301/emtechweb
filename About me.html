        <h2> MARIEL </h2>
        <br>
        <p> Origin: Dutch</p>
        <p> Meaning: Star of the sea</p>
        <br>
        <p> Once, a name disturb the quiet symphony 
            Its melody is like the sound of the sea <br>
            With a wave  that muffles in synergy, <br> <br>
             While its rhythms crawled towards the shore,
             Making known of its mysterious lore <br>
            The name that was bestowed to the star of the sea
            Were shining brightly in hope and glee. 
            
             </p> <br><br><br>
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWhen I was born, I came into the world as a blank canvas. It was up to me to paint the picture of who<br>
             I would be, and as much as I've been enjoying that process since day one, I also have a fair share of struggle
              with it, however imagination has always been a core part of me, and I've been expressing it through various mediums ever since I could hold a pen and read a book, which had helped me to cope. </p>
