  <p>  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I am not particularly fond of coding and programming that's
     why when we were given a project related to programming I thought it
      would really be a pain and I was already lamenting for my quiet
       and peaceful days however as I and my friends gather to do the 
       project together, I was able to learned that doing it was fun and 
       easy,  and with the help of my friends I was able to enjoy the 
       project. As of now I'm still forging my way through the basics of
        html languages. I might say this project change my view in terms
         of programming and coding, and this experience help me to be more 
         interested in ICT, that's why, I'm very much excited for more challenges 
         to come. </p>
